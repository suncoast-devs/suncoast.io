title: Why do we teach React?

The modern web runs on JavaScript. This is why the for the first few weeks we focus on the basics of JavaScript (and HTML and CSS). But to truly be job ready, our students need to learn a JavaScript framework. JavaScript frameworks tend to have a relatively short life span, what is taught to a student at the time of learning is relatively trivial, as long as the student receives exposure to using a framework. 


React was chosen because it is a widely popular framework that has disrupted the JavaScript framework landscape and, for the most part, leverages mostly existing JavaScript knowledge. React has become the point of reference for many new, and even old, frameworks, and in learning React, it gives the students a scalable point of reference to learning what ever framework is next in there career. In addition to building a strong foundation with a growing framework, we have found that React is relatively easy for new developers to wrap their heads around and allows to easily create beautiful, dynamic sites while still learning the basics of front-end development. It's often said that React makes developers better JavaScript developers.
