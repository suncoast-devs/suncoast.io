The Academy at Suncoast Developers Guild is an immersive _code school_. What that means is, in about three months (with the guidance and support of seasoned industry experts) you will gain the skills needed to become a junior developer. Over the course of the curriculum, you will learn the basics of web development and also how to be job-ready for the modern market. This immersive style of education is often called a "bootcamp" because of the fast pace of learning and the full-time commitment.
