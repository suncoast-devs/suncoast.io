Yes, you will be given homework assignments and projects. We always encourage you to have _**you**_ time and give yourself a day or at least a few hours to recharge over the weekend so you can come in on Monday and be ready to learn.  Our students spend 60 to 80 hours a week and part of the learning process is learning time management and how to balance your work and personal schedule. Although this program requires more than the typical 40 hour work week, this type of accelerated environment is proven successful to get you skilled up and ready to be a developer.
