It's easy and free. There is no cost or obligation to attend if you apply. You'll meet with a member of our admissions and instructional teams where some of your questions or concerns will be answered. 

We encourage you to bring anyone from your support group that you feel may want understand more about where you will be spending a large portion of your time for three months.

After that, we let you know if you are accepted and then you can start your prework and _welcome aboard!_
