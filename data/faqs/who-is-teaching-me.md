We have some of the most skilled developers teaching our courses. They are passionate about coding, learning, and most importantly you! Seriously though, we have identified developers who are industry practitioners but also leading and organizing community events for over a decade to share their knowledge and love for the craft. Our instructors are teachers and mentors first and foremost. They are also seriously bad ass developers.
