Check out the how do I apply above, but no, you should not be nervous. This is a time where we get to know each other and want to see if we are a good fit for each other. We want to set you up for success when going through our program. If we (you and SDG) decide now is not the right time, we will give you resources and support to get you ready to be successful going through the program.
