role: Chief Executive Officer
long_bio: >-
  Jason is a native Floridian who started building for the web as a teen in the
  mid-’90s, so he’s been a web developer for about as long as anybody.
  Co-founding the Tampa Ruby Brigade in 2006, Suncoast Developers Guild in 2015,
  Jason takes pride in being a leader in the local tech community. After stints
  in academia, startups, and as a consulting freelancer, he’s found great joy in
  mentoring and sharing the knowledge gained along the way. He’s also a game
  development enthusiast, passionate about cryptocurrency, and loves animation.
  Jason is a father, a skeptic, entirely too opinionated, and prefers a word
  count in powers of two. When the world gets heavy you can find him either
  unbuilding LEGO® sets as catharsis or harnessing his power animal -- the
  panda.
